# country-name-generator
A very simple program that (tries to) generate names for fictional and fantasy countries, nations, territories and etcetera.

This was a very early attempt of mine in creating a "bit-responsive" web page and writing some basic JavaScript code and using Git. 

## How it works?

The program generates 10 names at start and lets the user to save them by clicking over them. It is possible to generate more names by clicking in the "Generate" button.
